            <p><h3>Hey Shitaa</h3></p>
            <p> I wanted to make something big and special and beautiful for you, but could not since me being not so good at the frontend so this is what I could prepare for you.</p>
            <p>  I have something very important to tell you. You've been an incredible friend to me, and I cherish the moments we've shared together. Your intelligence, kindness, and warmth I also have loved very much.</p>
            <p>Today, I want to express my deepest feelings for you. I have come to realize that you mean more to me than just a friend. You are someone I admire, respect, and adore deeply. I tried to keep the friendship between us but I don't think its working for me and I think its same for you too, so let's give our relationship another try.</p>
            <p>Shitaa I can't imagine my life without you in it. I wanted to write some songs here but that would not show my efforts so this is what I did to impress you as I used to do earlier, and this took so much work by the way, I had to learn some things in order to pull this off. So let me ask you something:</p>
            <p><h4>Will you be my Girlfriend Darshuu?</h4></p>
